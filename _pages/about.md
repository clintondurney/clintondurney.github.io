I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia working under the supervision of [Dr. James J. Feng](https://www.math.ubc.ca/~jfeng/).  My research focus is Mathematical Biology where I am currently studying cell and tissue scale level mechanics of the developing  *Drosophila* embryo.  I utilize a number of techniques including mathematical modelling, computational biology and analysis. I hold affiliations with the [Mathematics Department](http://www.math.ubc.ca) and the [Institute of Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/). 

Prior to UBC, I earned my MS in Mathematics at The Ohio State University working with [Dr. Chuan Xue](https://people.math.osu.edu/xue.41/) writing a thesis on multi-scale modelling of bacterial chemotaxis.  I earned BS degrees in Physics and Mathematics at Virginia Tech.  While at VT, I did undergraduate research with [Dr. Michel Pleimling](http://www1.phys.vt.edu/~pleim/main.html) and [Dr. Royce K.P. Zia](http://www1.phys.vt.edu/~rkpzia/HmPg.html) of the VT Physics Dept. 

In my spare time, I can often be found running the streets of Vancouver or the trails of the North Shore mountains. Below are my weekly stats!
