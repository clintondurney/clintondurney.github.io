I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia working under the supervision of James J. Feng.  My research focus is Mathematical Biology where I am currently studying cell and tissue scale level mechanics of the developing  *Drosophila* embryo.  I utilize a number of techniques including mathematical modelling, computational biology and analysis. I hold affiliations with the Mathematics Department and the Institute of Applied Mathematics.
