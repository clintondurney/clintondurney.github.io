I am a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of British Columbia working under the supervision of Dr. James J. Feng.  My research focus is Mathematical Biology where I am currently studying cell and tissue scale level mechanics of the developing  *Drosophila* embryo.  I utilize a number of techniques including mathematical modelling, computational biology and analysis. I hold affiliations with the Mathematics Department and the Institute of Applied Mathematics. 

Prior to UBC, I earned my MS in Mathematics at The Ohio State University working with Dr. Chuan Xue.  And prior to that I earned BS degrees in Physics and Mathematics at Virginia Tech.  While at VT, I did undergraduate research with Dr. Michel Pleimling and Dr. Royce K.P. Zia of the VT Physics Dept.
