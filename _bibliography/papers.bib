abstract = {Generalizing the cyclically competing three-species model (often referred to as the rock-paper-scissors game), we consider a simple system of population dynamics without spatial structures that involves four species. Unlike the previous model, the four form alliance pairs which resemble partnership in the game of Bridge. In a finite system with discrete stochastic dynamics, all but 4 of the absorbing states consist of coexistence of a partner-pair. From a master equation, we derive a set of mean-field equations of evolution. This approach predicts complex time dependence of the system and that the surviving partner-pair is the one with the larger product of their strengths (rates of consumption). Simulations typically confirm these scenarios. Beyond that, much richer behavior is revealed, including complicated extinction probabilities and non-trivial distributions of the population ratio in the surviving pair. These discoveries naturally raise a number of intriguing questions, which in turn suggests a variety of future avenues of research, especially for more realistic models of multispecies competition in nature.},

abstract = {We study the stochastic evolution of four species in cyclic competition in a well mixed environment. In systems composed of a finite number {\$}N{\$} of particles these simple interaction rules result in a rich variety of extinction scenarios, from single species domination to coexistence between non-interacting species. Using exact results and numerical simulations we discuss the temporal evolution of the system for different values of {\$}N{\$}, for different values of the reaction rates, as well as for different initial conditions. As expected, the stochastic evolution is found to closely follow the mean-field result for large {\$}N{\$}, with notable deviations appearing in proximity of extinction events. Different ways of characterizing and predicting extinction events are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a vertex-based model for Drosophila dorsal closure that predicts the mechanics of cell oscillation and contraction from the dynamics of the PAR proteins. Based on experimental observations of how aPKC, Par-6, and Bazooka translocate from the circumference of the apical surface to the medial domain, and how they interact with each other and ultimately regulate the apicomedial actomyosin, we formulate a system of differential equations that captures the key features of dorsal closure, including distinctive behaviors in its early, slow, and fast phases. The oscillation in cell area in the early phase of dorsal closure results from an intracellular negative feedback loop that involves myosin, an actomyosin regulator, aPKC, and Bazooka. In the slow phase, gradual sequestration of apicomedial aPKC by Bazooka clusters causes incomplete disassembly of the actomyosin network over each cycle of oscillation, thus producing a so-called ratchet. The fast phase of rapid cell and tissue contraction arises when medial myosin, no longer antagonized by aPKC, builds up in time and produces sustained contraction. Thus, a minimal set of rules governing the dynamics of the PAR proteins, extracted from experimental observations, can account for all major mechanical outcomes of dorsal closure, including the transitions between its three distinct phases.},

abstract = {Population dynamics in systems composed of cyclically competing species has been of increasing interest recently. Here we investigate a system with four or more species. Using mean field theory, we study in detail the trajectories in configuration space of the population fractions. We discover a variety of orbits, shaped like saddles, spirals, and straight lines. Many of their properties are found explicitly. Most remarkably, we identify a collective variable that evolves simply as an exponential: Q ∝ e($\lambda$t), where $\lambda$ is a function of the reaction rates. It provides information on the state of the system for late times (as well as for t→-∞). We discuss implications of these results for the evolution of a finite, stochastic system. A generalization to an arbitrary number of cyclically competing species yields valuable insights into universal properties of such systems.},
